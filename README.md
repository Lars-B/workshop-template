# Template website

This is a template website to host a workshop or something similar online.


## Installation

Needs a quarto installation to be hosted locally [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

To preview the website use
```bash
quarto preview
```

### Quarto extensions

To get icons from [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), for example the R-project icon in the navbar
we are using the [fontawesome](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome) extension.
It has to be installed seperately:

```{bash}
quarto add quarto-ext/fontawesome
```
